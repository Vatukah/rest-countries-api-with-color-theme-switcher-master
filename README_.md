### What I learned

I learned various things while completing this project such as fetching data from rest api,
and implementing fetched data in different algorithm.
It also increase the knowledge and help me in knowing the advantage grid

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
#home {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
    padding: 2% 10% 0% 10%;
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }
```
